Today we're going to learn about [Git](https://git-scm.com), a [version control](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) system by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), and the [GitHub](https://github.com) [open source universe](https://github.com/open-source). Did you know [Apple](https://github.com/apple), [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) and [Google](https://github.com/google) all share parts of their source code on [GitHub](https://github.com)? Sharing is caring!

> **Note:** If you haven't yet signed up for the [student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) on GitHub I suggest you do that [as soon as possible](https://i.giphy.com/lRnUWhmllPI9a.gif). [GitHub](https://yrgo.github.io/services/github) is going to be a part of your everyday workflow here at [Yrgo](https://yrgo.github.io). Don't forget to [add your school email address](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account) to your GitHub account.

## Assignments

#### Git Basics

1. If you haven't installed [GitHub Desktop](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-desktop/install-github-desktop) yet, download it and login to your GitHub account.

2. [Create a new repository on GitHub](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-desktop/create-remote-repository) with a [`README.md`](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis) file and name the repository `hello-world`.

3. [Clone the repository with GitHub Desktop](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-desktop/clone-repository-github-desktop) and open up the project in your favorite editor.

4. Add a new [`<h1>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) (in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown)) at the top of the [`README.md`](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis) file and write the text `Hello World`.

5. Back in GitHub Desktop, add a new commit message/summary and [commit your changes to master branch](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-desktop/push-with-github-desktop).

6. [Push your changes to GitHub](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-desktop/push-with-github-desktop).

7. You should now see your changes appear on your repository page on GitHub.

8. Now [add a Gif](https://giphy.com/) to the README.md file, but do this with the Github-editor and not in your local directory. Commit the changes.

9. Open Github Desktop and Pull origin. You should now see the changes you made on Github in your local directory.

10. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) a classmate's repo to your Github account.

11. [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop) the forked repository to your local computer.

12. Make some changes, push them and make a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-pull-request) to your classmates repo. Help your classmate [merge](https://help.github.com/en/articles/merging-a-pull-request) the Pull Request.

## Extra

13. Back in you own repository, let's create a new file in local directory and name it `ignore-this-file.txt`.

14. Now create a .gitignore file. Write ignore-this-file.txt in the .gitignore file.

15. Add and Commit the changes in Github Desktop. Push your changes to Github.

16. The `ignore-this-file.txt` file should not be on Github, due to the .gitignore file.

17. Sign up and get ready to join [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com)!

18. Watch the following video about [GitHub and GitHub Desktop](https://youtu.be/C69-s2o9wqw)
